# Project2

This project is what I originally called "Retro PC Gaming Hub" which is a 
bulletin board service where the user posts an ad for people they want to play 
games with, usually older games that don't have hubs or very active communties. 
The idea behind it is for old PC games that have multiplayer that seems abandned 
or forgotten and there is no gathering place for anybody still interested 
to set up play sessions. These are usually older games classified as "abandonware" 
or those that are not nearly as played or rely on legacy things such as play by email 
or sharing an IP address, or playing LAN over Hamachi or something to that effect. 

The approach I took originally was to create a service where the user signs into 
a service an can view all ads. I was not able to get this working and ended up scrapping it 
and instead made it a full public service where people post a bulletin and the username 
is now functionally more like a nickname one would use in a comment section for the ones 
that did not require registration. The user can view all listings and see if a game relevant 
to them is posted and to follow up the contact information in the listing if interested. 
If they don't find anything, they can create a post with the information including their display name, 
the thread title, game title, the message they can explain more with if it's a game that they want certain 
conditions on such as mods or difficulty preferences if they wish, leave their contact information, and 
even an optional screenshot if they wish. 

The biggest problem was at the time this was developed, there was a phenomenon that people in history 
will know of as the "Toilet Paper Famine of 2020", and I had to run around during this time to make 
sure I was able to have enough supplies for myself that were being panic bought by individuals. This was 
due to the SARS-Cov2 virus spreading around and going pandemic. I fully intend on returning to this project and 
making it work far closer to my original vision as I find myself largely unsatisfied with how it turned out in several 
ways.
